# reading-mode-ext

In this extension if calculated the read time based on the words present on the webpage inside article or section tag.
Its working perfectly for medium articles.

# Future Changes

- May be to display some navbar at top with a message of read time on every web page.
- In Version2 i will try to bring extension ui where i will show the read time.
- Whenever you will see this try finding reading-mode-ext-V2.
